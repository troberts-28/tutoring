# Letter of Sean ... or Was It Marque?
This repo will possibly become an entry to the [binny birthday jam](https://itch.io/jam/binnys-birthday-jam-2022)

## Outline
You commandeer a ship (nautical term™) and you have cannons. What you do not have is gold.
So sail away, plunder some ships, and upgrade yours.
Upgrades give you extended range, more cannons (shoot in parallel), 
Bathe (nautical term™) in the nostalgic feeling of playing a totally underrated mini game from a traditional Point&Click adventure from somewhere deep in the carribean.  
**~~No sword fights~~ Not more than 3 sword fights were fought during the production of this game.**

Feel free to add, adapt, or otherwise tinker with the project. Especially writing enemy AI was 
completely out of scope of this game jam and would need some love :)
